Create a news site about pot plants using flexbox and make it responsive.


## The problem

first I made a sketch on a piece of paper to figure out what my layout would look like. I watched videos that were on canvas. I started on my project but realized that I had too high ambitions! Nothing worked the way I wanted and I also discovered that I had not started with mobile first. And I got caught up in design details, so I started over. I decided to make my project much less complicated and just focus on understanding flexbox and making the page responsive. Then I wrote the HTML structure first to avoid getting stuck in the design. Then I followed a lot of what jennie did in the codealong video, it was very helpful! It has also been helpful to have an extra meeting with those on the team and ask them questions and help each other with problems.
If I had more time, I would have liked to try to add some animation to my project. I'm not sure if the page is responsive now, but I hope so, but I would have liked to be completely sure. I still have not understood how to make the pictures and boxes stop growing.
